# Sentiment Analysis Prediction Pipeline

This project implements a streamlined prediction pipeline for classifying the sentiment (Positive or Negative) of a given text input using a pre-trained Machine Learning model. The core of the pipeline is built around essential Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques: Preprocessing, Vectorization, and Classification.

## How It Works (The Pipeline)

The four key stages required to turn raw text into a sentiment prediction:

1.  **Input:** A raw string of text (e.g., "great product, I love it!!!!!!").
2.  **Preprocessing:** Cleans the text by removing noise, standardizing case, and reducing words to their roots.
3.  **Vectorization:** Converts the clean text into a numerical format (a feature vector) that the model can understand.
4.  **Prediction:** The trained model classifies the numerical vector as either 'positive' or 'negative'.

## Key Functions

### 1. `preprocessing(text)`
This function is the text-cleaning step. It applies the following in order:
* Lowercasing
* URL removal
* Punctuation removal (via `remove_punctuation`)
* Digit removal
* Stopword removal (using the loaded `sw` list)
* Stemming (using the `PorterStemmer`)

**Input:** Raw text string.
**Output:** A clean, stemmed pandas Series object containing the processed text (e.g., "great product love").

### 2. `vectorizer(ds, vocabulary)`
This function implements the **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** vectorization model.
* It checks the preprocessed text (`ds`) against the training vocabulary (`tokens`).
* It creates a binary vector: `1` if a vocabulary word is present in the text, `0` if it is absent.

**Input:** Preprocessed text and the vocabulary list.
**Output:** A NumPy array (vector) of 0s and 1s, ready for the model.

### 3. `get_prediction(vectorized_txt)`
The final classification step.
* It feeds the numerical vector into the pre-loaded `model`.
* It translates the model's numerical output (0 or 1) into a readable sentiment label.

**Input:** The numerical feature vector.
**Output:** The sentiment label: `'positive'` (for prediction `0`) or `'negetive'` (for prediction `1`).

## 🔑 How to Run

1.  Ensure all required files (`.pkl` model, `vocabulary.txt`, `english` stopwords list) are correctly placed relative to the notebook as shown in the paths above.
2.  Run all cells in the `prediction_pipeline.ipynb` notebook sequentially.
3.  The final cells demonstrate the entire pipeline execution for test text inputs.
